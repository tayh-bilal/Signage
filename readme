# 📺 Digital Signage Player

A high-performance, auto-updating Electron application designed to synchronize video content across muti screens. This player uses a global clock synchronization method and a Supabase backend to ensure all screens play the same content at the exact same millisecond.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Global Sync:** Uses time-offset logic to ensure frame-accurate synchronization across multiple devices.
* **Dynamic Polling:** * **Idle Mode:** Checks for new content every 10 seconds when no video is assigned.
    * **Playback Mode:** Checks for updates every 60 minutes to save bandwidth.
* **Background Auto-Updates:** Downloads new app versions silently and restarts automatically via GitHub Releases.
* **Hardware-Based Identity:** Automatically generates a unique "Clean ID" from the device's MAC address (e.g., `08EDB99EB573`).

## 🛠 Project Structure
* `main.js`: Controls the Electron process, power management (prevents sleep), and the update engine.
* `player.html`: The core logic for video rendering, time-syncing, and polling Supabase.
* `package.json`: Manages dependencies and version control.
* `.gitignore`: Prevents heavy folders (`node_modules`, `dist`) from bloating the code repository.

## 🔄 How to Update the Code (Workflow)

When you need to change the player's behavior or fix a bug, follow these exact steps to update all the screens remotely.

### 1. Edit the Code
Make your changes locally in `player.html` or `main.js`. Test the changes by running:
```powershell
npm start



2. Increment the Version
The screens will only update if they detect a higher version number.

Open package.json.

Change "version": "1.0.4" to "version": "1.0.5" (or higher).

3. Build the Installer
Run the distribution script to package the app for Windows.

PowerShell:
npm install electron-updater --save
npx electron-builder --win

This will generate a dist/ folder containing:

signage-player Setup 1.0.5.exe (The installer)

latest.yml (The "instruction" file for the auto-updater)


            
4. Launch the New Version (GitHub Release)
The screens monitor the Releases section of this repository.
Go to your GitHub Repo -> Releases -> Draft a new release.
Tag version: v1.0.5 (must match package.json).
Upload Assets: Drag and drop BOTH the .exe and the latest.yml from your dist/ folder.
Publish Release.

📡 The Update Lifecycle
Once you click Publish, the following happens automatically:
Detection: Within 60 minutes, the player checks GitHub and sees a new version is available.
Silent Download: The player downloads the new installer in the background while the current video continues to play.
Self-Installation: Once the download is 100% complete, the app calls quitAndInstall().
Auto-Restart: The app closes, installs the update, and relaunches within 10 seconds.
Recovery: The player reads the existing screen-config.json, identifies itself, and resumes the playlist.

🔧 New Screen Setup
Download the latest .exe from the Releases tab.
Install on a Windows PC.
On first launch, a Green ID (MAC Address) will appear on the clock screen.
Add this ID to your Supabase screens table to begin pushing content.

⌨️ Local Controls
F11: Toggle Fullscreen.
Arrow Right / Left: Adjust time offset (+/- 0.05s) to fine-tune synchronization.
Ctrl+R: Force Reload.
